## Metrics emitted by the Loggregator subsystem

As of Loggregator 82 Metrics are now documented inline with specifics about what the metric represents. Here are some searches that you can use to get a summary of all metrics. 

[`metrics-documentation-v1`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=metric-documentation-v1&type=Code) - These are all metrics related to Dropsonde envelopes. 

[`metrics-documentation-v2`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=metric-documentation-v2&type=Code) - These are all metrics for the new Loggretor API V2

[`DEPRECATAED`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=DEPRECATED) - These are all metrics that will be deprecated in a future release. They are usually adjacent to a new replacement for the metric or no longer provide value.

[`USELESS`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=USELESS) - These metrics do not provide a meaningful datapoint and should not be used.
